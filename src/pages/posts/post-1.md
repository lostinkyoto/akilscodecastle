This is the first post. If you're reading this, the build didn't break. That’s promising. Also the internt still works. So maybe the apocalypse hasn't hit yet. 

## What’s working

1. **Astro project boots up.** So far, so good.
2. **Pages live under `src/pages/`.** They render. I can link to them.
3. **Markdown blog engine runs.** You're inside it right now.


More soon, probably. Or not. Depends what compiles.
